A library for generating 2d colliders, for bevy apps, from images with transparency

## Specifying your dependency

By default, both `bevy_rapier2d` and avian2d (formerly `bevy_xpbd_2d`) are enabled.
This is to help with the out of box experience, specifically,
being able to run both examples and tinker.

But you'll probably only want to just use one of the physics engines supported
so when you use it in your own crate fill in in the `bevy_collider_gen`
dependencies with something like this for `bevy_rapier2d`

```toml
[dependencies.bevy_collider_gen]
# replace "*" with the most recent version of bevy_collider_gen
version = "*"
```

Or this for `avian2d`

```toml
[dependencies.bevy_collider_gen]
# replace "*" with the most recent version of bevy_collider_gen
version = "*"
features = ["avian2d", "parallel"]
default-features = false
```

## Example

![example with a car, terrain, and boulders](https://github.com/shnewto/bevy_collider_gen/blob/main/img/example-default.png?raw=true)

To see this in action you can run the example, with no arguments
it generates a scene with various colliders using PNG's in the `assets/sprite` directory

### `bevy_rapier2d`

```sh
cargo run --example rapier2d_colliders
```

### avian2d

```sh
cargo run --example avian2d_colliders -F avian2d
```

You can also specify a path to an image yourself the example will attempt to
generate one or more `convex_polyline` colliders for the objects it finds

## About / why

I was looking for a way to iterate on some 2d scenes with colliders
on things with more sophisticated shapes than simple
geometry, I figured there should be enough info in an image with
transparency to generate colliders, and... there is! So i
packaged up my approach here in case anyone else could benefit.

## How it works

ðŸ˜„ head on over to the edges crate to learn more <https://github.com/shnewto/edges>

## Caveats

- as mentioned here and there in these docs, this implementation requires
  images to have transparency in order to distinguish object from non-object :)
- i imagine for generating things at a larger scale, i.e. colliders
  for sets of sprites bigger than pixel counts in the hundreds, this implementation
  won't be performant to do at runtime. I'll suggest serializing the colliders
  you like and deserializing in your app instead of doing all the number crunching
  on load when you need a performance boost

## Examples of colliders generated for assets/sprite/car.png

(as in pictures of the sort of thing you can expect,
not the runnable bevy app example. That's a couple headings up)

### convex polyline (`bevy_raiper2d` only)

### convex hull

### heightfield

The current implementation does best if the image
you're generating a heightfield from is either centered in the image
or spans the entire width of the image...

### convex decomposition

I didn't add support for convex decomposition directly because when
sprites were small, and collisions were forceful, they were sort of unreliable
(occasional panics because of bounds indexing in rapier's dependencies ðŸ’€).
But if you wanted to use convex decomposition colliders you could construct
them with the edge coordinates from your image with something like this

```rust
let sprite_image = image_assets.get(sprite_handle.unwrap()).unwrap();
let edges = Edges::try_from(sprite_image).unwrap();
let edge_coordinate_groups = edges.multi_translated();
for coords in edge_coordinate_groups {
    let indices: Vec<[u32; 2]> = (0..coords.len()).map(|i| [i as u32, i as u32]).collect();
    let collider = Collider::convex_decomposition(&coords, &indices);
    commands.spawn((
        collider,
        RigidBody::Fixed,
        SpriteBundle {
            texture: sprite_handle.unwrap().clone(),
            ..default()
        },
    ));
}
```
